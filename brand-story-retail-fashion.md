## Brand story – Youth Streetwear Co.

Youth Streetwear Co. is a small retail fashion brand focused on selling shirts and jeans for urban youth (ages 18–30). The founder, Aarav, started the brand to offer well‑fitting, durable, and affordable basics that still feel stylish enough for college, casual Fridays at work, and late‑night outings. Instead of chasing luxury pricing, the brand aims to become the “everyday uniform” for young people in fast‑growing Indian cities.

Aarav incorporates a private limited company and opens a current account with a local bank. He invests his own savings as equity capital and keeps the books simple from day one. Youth Streetwear Co. uses Finager to:

- Maintain a clean chart of accounts and audit‑ready journals.
- Track contacts for suppliers (fabric and garment manufacturers), service providers (designers, photographers), and customers buying in bulk.
- Prepare for inventory purchases (finished shirts and jeans) that will be stocked and sold in the coming weeks.

In the first phase, before any inventory purchases are made, Youth Streetwear Co. books:

- Owner capital introduced into the business.
- Cash transferred into the bank current account.
- Basic pre‑operating and setup expenses (like branding, logo design, and registration fees) paid in cash or via bank.

Once these opening balances and expenses are recorded, Aarav is ready to start purchasing inventory (finished shirts and jeans) from vendors and to use Finager’s inventory‑linked expenses and invoice posting flows to manage stock and sales.
